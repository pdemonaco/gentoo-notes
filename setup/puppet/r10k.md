# Git Configuration

1. Create a new repository for r10k on your machine.
2. Initialize this repository as follows:

    ```bash
    REPO_DIR="${HOME}/repo/pdemon-sysconfig/r10k"
    cd "${REPO_DIR}"

    # Initialize the repo
    git init
     
    # Create the base structure
    mkdir -p {modules,data,manifests}
    touch hiera.yaml
    touch environment.conf
    touch Puppetfile
    touch manifests/site.pp
    git add ./*
    git commit
     
    # Rename the branch to match puppet's expectation
    git branch -m production
     
    # Push the branch up 
    REPO_URL="git@gitlab.com:pdemon-sysconfig/r10k.git"
    git remote add origin "${REPO_URL}"
    git push -u origin production
    ```
3. Ensure git is installed on the puppet master server.

    ```bash
    # Gentoo
    emerge -avt git
     
    # SLES 
    zypper install git
     
    # RHEL/Centos
    yum install git
    ```
4. Ensure the root user on that server has access to the newly created git repository.
5. Validate that it's working by cloning the new r10k repo to the system.

# Installation

1. Ensure that the puppetmaster is configured at least in part and the cert has been generated for the master via `puppet cert list --all`.

2. Unmask and install the current version of r10k. 

    ```bash
    # Unmask the current version of r10k. Note other stuff may be needed too. 
    echo "app-admin/r10k ~amd64" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/r10k

    emerge -avt app-admin/r10k
    ```
3. Create the config file and it's directory.

    ```bash
    R10K_DIR="/etc/puppetlabs/r10k/"
    mkdir "${R10K_DIR}"
    touch "${R10K_DIR}/r10k.yaml"
    ```
4. Initialize that config file as follows.

    ```bash
    # The location to use for storing cached Git repos
    :cachedir: '/var/cache/r10k'

    # A list of git repositories to create
    :sources:
    # This will clone the git repository and instantiate an environment per
    # branch in /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments
      :pdemon-sysconfig:
        remote: 'git@gitlab.com:pdemon-sysconfig/r10k'
        basedir: '/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments'
    ```
5. Fetch the current version of the repository and deploy it.

    ```bash
    # Fetch it
    r10k deploy display --fetch

    # Deploy it
    r10k deploy environment -p
    ```
